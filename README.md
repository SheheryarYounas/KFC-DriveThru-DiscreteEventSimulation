# KFC-DriveThru-DiscreteEventSimulation
KFC Drive-Thru Simulation: A Java-based discrete event simulation that models the drive-thru operation of a KFC restaurant. The simulation generates a random sequence of inter-arrival times and service times using the Poisson distribution, and records the arrival, service start, service end, and departure times for each customer. The simulation also collects statistics on customer waiting times, queue lengths, and server utilization. The project uses the Apache Commons Math library for the Poisson distribution and follows object-oriented design principles.
